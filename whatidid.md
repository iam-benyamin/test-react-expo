`npm install expo`

use `npx create-expo-app ProjectName` instead of `expo init ProjectName` 

start app with `npm start`

download and install android studio and jdk

on ubuntu with `sudo apt install`

after install android studio and test it I don't want to use it because my system can't handle it
so i decide to uninstall it
